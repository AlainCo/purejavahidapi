PureJavaHidApi is a crossplatform  Application Programmin Interface (API) for accessing USB HID devices from Java, so it is a library aimed at programmers, not end users.


PureJavaHidApi is written 100% in Java so it is easy for Java programmers to develop and debug and it requires no native libraries. Native access to the underlaying operating system's USB device interface is provided by the wonderful JNA library which takes away all the pain of compiling and deploying native code.

PureJavaHidApi is BSD licensed but please note it depends on JNA which is LGPL/ASL dual licensed.

The definitive PureJavaHidApi reference is the <a href="nyholku.github.io/purejavahidapi/index.html"> JavaDoc </a>.
